# -Flight-Data-Analysis
Using the datasets from https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7, the following querstions were answered using Python and R focusing on the years 2006 and 2007.
1. When is the best time of day, day of the week, and time of year to fly to minimise delays?
2. Do older planes suffer more delays?
3. How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
4. Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others?
5. Use the available variables to construct a model that predicts delays.

The data was first cleaned and the tasks were done with the cleaned dataset.

For the Question 5, a logistic regression model was constructed to predict delays.
